# Code Injector Themes

Website alterations to suit personal preference, changes UI and/or styles. Can be used with any extension that allows you to add your own styles or scripts to a page. I'm using [Code Injector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/codeinjector/) for Firefox.

Personal use stuff, just adding these to a repo because the code doesn't sync between browsers/machines and I want to back them up in case I change systems or extensions in the future.
